# Multi-User Todo App – Full Stack Learning Project

This project is a **learning-focused full-stack application**
built to understand how frontend and backend communicate using REST APIs.

## 🧱 Architecture
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript & React (separate clients)
- Data Storage: In-memory (for learning)

## 🚀 Features
- User management (add / delete users)
- User-specific todos
- Add, delete, and toggle todos
- RESTful API design

## 📂 Project Structure
- `server/` → Express backend
- `client-vanilla/` → HTML + JS frontend
- `client-react/` → React version (WIP)

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- REST API design
- Client–server interaction
- State handling
- Clean project structure

## ⚠️ Note
This project intentionally uses **in-memory storage**
to focus on logic and API flow.
Database integration is a planned enhancement.

## 📦 Installation (Node Modules Not Included)
Node modules are intentionally excluded.

### Backend
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
